				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Sparda and its unawakened form, the Force Edge, is the beloved demon-forged sword wielded by the The Dark Knight Sparda himself, and magically imbued with his power. Throughout the series, the sword is recognized as a source of god-like power, and in Devil May Cry 3, it was the main objective of the villains</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Rebellion is Dante's trademark sword appearing throughout the series. Though it has the form of a standard claymore, it is a magical blade given to him as a keepsake from his father, Sparda. It serves as both a physical manifestation of his power, and through its name, meaning "resistance", a symbol of his spirit. The blade's power originally laid dormant, but through contact with Dante's blood, it was awakened.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Yamato once belonged to Vergil's father, Sparda, and according to the Order of the Sword, it was used to seal the "true Hell Gate". It was eventually given to Vergil as a memento, and he used it as his primary weapon. Vergil uses Yamato as his primary weapon while attempting to reactivate the Temen-ni-gru. When his attempt fails, Vergil and his Yamato fall into the Demon World, where he is found by Mundus. Vergil attempts to defeat the demon king like his father, but is defeated and reborn as Nelo Angelo, presumably along with his blade.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Ebony & Ivory are Dante's trademark pair of personally customized, semi-automatic pistols, designed to rapidly fire bullets instilled with his demonic power, and are the only weapon to appear in every installment in the series. The right-handed white gun, Ivory, was custom built for rapid firing and fast draw times, while the left-handed black gun, Ebony, has been modified for long-distance targeting and comfort. In Devil May Cry 3, upgrading it raises its max firepower.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Summoned Swords are magically generated blades resembling the Force Edge. They are wielded by Vergil throughout the gameplay.

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Kalina Ann is Lady's trademark rocket launcher, and appears in Devil May Cry 3, the anime and Devil May Cry 4. It has the name of Lady's mother etched into the handle, and the bayonet attached to it can be used as a grappling hook or a close-quarters weapon. [1] Its long reload time can be circumvented by quickly switching guns between shots, allowing it to quickly take out entire crowds of enemies. Upgrading it increases its firing speed. In Devil May Cry 3, Lady lends the Kalina Ann to Dante after their fight in The Divine Library. She asks him to use this to "free" her father. Later, when Dante returns from the Demon World, he returns it to her.</p>
