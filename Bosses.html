				<p>Twin Demon gatekeepers of Temen-ni-gru sealed away by Sparda, Agni & Rudra the Firestorm are a pair of living swords, swung by demon hosts, searching for an owner worthy of their power. Agni is the red sword with power to control fire, while Rudra is the blue sword with power to control wind. The headless demons that wield them also match this color scheme.</p>

				<p>Jester is Arkham's alter ego. In this persona, Jester frequently taunts Dante, but occasionally provides some helpful hints and tips to him. In Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, Jester also serves as a recurring boss, who can be fought three times, and his battles use circus props. He also seems to "bleed" confetti when struck.</p>

				<p>Beowulf the Lightbeast is one of the gatekeepers of Temen-ni-gru, half-blinded and sealed away for 2000 years by Sparda. When his four wings are hidden, Beowulf resembles Pazuzu, the Babylonian king of the demons of the wind. He mainly walks on all four limbs, but is also able to stand and move about on two legs. Beowulf anxiously awaits his chance at revenge. He possesses overwhelming strength and a variety of light attacks.</p>

				<p>Cerberus is the Gatekeeper of the entrance to the Temen-ni-gru, chained up and sealed away by Sparda. Cerberus is a three-headed hellhound willing to grant power to the worthy. He has the power to control ice, which he uses to encase himself in ice armor, summon showers of icicles, and belch small icebergs. Each of his heads uses different techniques. Also his hind paws seem to be missing and replaced with ice this can be spotted when Cerberus lunges his head(s) at the player.</p>

				<p>Doppelganger is a Demon composed of shadow that takes the same shape of his foes by refracting light in various directions. When in an area with darkness, the demon resembles that of Dante in his Devil Trigger form. However, Doppelganger resembles more of Dante's normal form when exposed to the light.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Geryon was once a horse of legend ridden by countless heroes, until ingesting demonic essence corrupted and empowered him with limited control over time. He leads a ghostly hearse, equipped with a heavy armament. When Dante first steps upon the bridge in the Underground Arena, Geryon engages him in a game of "Chicken" until the bridge collapses and they fall into a colosseum. After Dante defeats Geryon, Dante receives his soul as the Quicksilver attack Style.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Hell Vanguard is known as the god of death, and is responsible for managing the souls of the dead. It is feared by other demons for its sadistic personality and combat tactics, including the abilities to teleport and fly.[1] Unlike other Hells, it does not seem to manifest through the same kind of sand, but rather by a mysterious blue dust.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Leviathan is a hybrid creature, having features of a whale and an eel. It uses its three eel-like tails to swim through the air as if it were water. Though its mouth resembles that of a baleen whale, it has sharp teeth, a feature exclusive to toothed whales. To give one a sense of perspective, Dante can fit inside of its eye. Its heart and lungs can be considered their own entity, and one that will protect itself with dark energy spheres and red lasers. Leviathan's digestive tract is populated by two Gigapedes and many Hell Envies. The design on Leviathan's heart and its behavior, down to the sound file used for its pained scream when its lungs are injured, are the same as those on the Nightmare.</p>
